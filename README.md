# Kuwahara Filter
Implementing Kuwahara filter in Unity, for the built-in renderer. Includes a basic Kuwahara filter and a generalized Kuwahara filter.

The Kuwahara filter was originally developed to denoise medical images, but due to the paint brush-like artifacts it creates,
it is now used for artistic effect.

This project is heavily inspired by the YouTube video
["This is the Kuwahara Filter"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDhN-JK3U9g&t=715s&pp=ygUPa3V3YWhhcmEgZmlsdGVy)
by Acerola. Code for the generalized Kuwahara filter is based on the white paper
"Anisotropic Kuwahara Filtering with Polynomial Weighting Functions" by Jan Eric Kyprianidis,
Amir Semmo, Henry Kang, Jürgen Döllner.
